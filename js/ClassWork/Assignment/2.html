<!-- Task 2: Live Character Counter
Objective: Practice real-time DOM updates.
Instructions:

- Create a text area with a counter showing remaining characters (e.g., “Characters left:
100”).
- As the user types, update the count in real time.
- Stop further typing once the limit is reached.
Bonus (5 marks): Add color change (green → orange → red) as the limit approaches. -->
