<!-- Task 4: Post Loader with Delayed Promise
Objective: Simulate delayed data loading using Promises.
Instructions:

- Create a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds with an array of blog post titles.
- Use async/await to “load” posts and display them as a list in the DOM.
- While loading, show a message: “Loading posts…”
Bonus: Add a retry mechanism if the Promise rejects. -->
