<!-- Task 6: Sequential Promise Execution
Objective: Demonstrate understanding of Promise chaining and async flow.
Instructions:

- Create three Promises that resolve after 1 second each, returning “Step 1 done”, “Step 2
done”, and “Step 3 done”.
- Chain them using .then() or use async/await to log each step sequentially in the DOM (as
list items).
Bonus: Highlight the current step in bold as it executes. -->
