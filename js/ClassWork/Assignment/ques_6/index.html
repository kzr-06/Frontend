<!-- Task 1: Fetch and Display User Data
Objective: Test API fetching using async/await and DOM rendering.
Instructions:

- Use the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Fetch all users asynchronously and display their name, email, and city in a table.
- Add a “Refresh” button to re-fetch and update the data on the DOM.
Bonus: Show a loading spinner while data is being fetched. -->
